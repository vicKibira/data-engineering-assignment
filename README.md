# Project Summary

## Overview

This consists of an M-Pesa statement and repayment data analysis in developing a credit scoring model with associate insight derivation. We leveraged the power of a number of data engineering and visualization tools in the completion of this assignment.

## Project Tasks

1. **Data Analysis and Visualization**:
- **Visual Insights**: Numerous visualizations were developed that can help portray trends and patterns of M-Pesa data transactions, such as pie charts, bar charts, doughnut charts, and grouped bar charts.
- **SQL Queries**: Wrote SQL queries to do most of the tasks like:
- Counting records and distinct users.
- Identifying the latest records per user.
- Find the top 5 users with maximum records.
- Showing number of records per day.

2. **Application Development**:
- **Streamlit/Dash Application**: Developed an application to:
â€¢ Accept CSV uploads from users.
- Display basic summary statistics and visualizations.
- Save it in a PostgreSQL database.
- Provide a confirmation of response after uploading and storing data.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, plotly.express, streamlit/dash
- **Database**: PostgreSQL running in Docker **Query Language**: SQL - **Version Management**: Git
